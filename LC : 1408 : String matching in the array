Hint
Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that are a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
Explanation: No string of words is substring of another string.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 30
words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words are unique.



Solution ::


class Solution {
    public List<String> stringMatching(String[] words) {
         List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        String allWords = String.join(" ", words); // Combine all words into one string

        for (String word : words) {
            if (allWords.indexOf(word) != allWords.lastIndexOf(word)) { // Check if word appears more than once
                result.add(word);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
