Hint
You are given a string s. Reorder the string using the following algorithm:

Remove the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
Remove the smallest character from s that is greater than the last appended character, and append it to the result.
Repeat step 2 until no more characters can be removed.
Remove the largest character from s and append it to the result.
Remove the largest character from s that is smaller than the last appended character, and append it to the result.
Repeat step 5 until no more characters can be removed.
Repeat steps 1 through 6 until all characters from s have been removed.
If the smallest or largest character appears more than once, you may choose any occurrence to append to the result.

Return the resulting string after reordering s using this algorithm.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
Output: "abccbaabccba"
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat"
Output: "art"
Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of only lowercase English letters.


Solution : 

class Solution {
    public String sortString(String s) {
        
          int[] count = new int[26];
        
        // Count frequency of each character
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int total = s.length();
        
        while (result.length() < total) {
            // Step 1-3: from 'a' to 'z'
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (count[i] > 0) {
                    result.append((char)(i + 'a'));
                    count[i]--;
                }
            }
            // Step 4-6: from 'z' to 'a'
            for (int i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (count[i] > 0) {
                    result.append((char)(i + 'a'));
                    count[i]--;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
}
